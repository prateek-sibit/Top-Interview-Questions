# Top-Interview-Questions
## Solutions of some common interview questions implemented in Python

## Problem Descriptions

- *anagram.py* : Construct an algorithm to check whether two words (or phrases) are anagrams or not!
- *duplicates.py* : We want to find duplicates in a one-dimensional array of integers in O(N) running time where the integer values are smaller than the length of the array!
- *largestsumsubarray.py* : Create an algorithm to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum!
- *middlelinkedlist.py* -  Suppose we have a standard linked list. Construct an in-place (without extra memory) algorithm thats able to find the middle node!
- *palindrome.py* - Our task is to design an optimal algorithm for checking whether a given string is palindrome or not!
- *reverseint.py* - Our task is to design an efficient algorithm to reverse a given integer. For example if the input of the algorithm is 1234 then the output should be 4321.
- *reverselinkedlist* - Construct an in-place algorithm to reverse a linked list!
